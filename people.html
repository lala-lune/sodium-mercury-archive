                    <b>Pierre and Marie Curie</b> were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 for their work on radioactivity. 
                    Marie Curie became the first woman to be awarded the nobel prize and the first person to obtain two 
                    nobel prizes when she won the prize for the discovery of Polonium and Radium in 1911.

                    Though it was Henri Becquerel that discovered radioactivity, it was Marie Curie who coined the term. 
                    Using a device invented by her husband and his brother that measured extremely low electrical 
                    currents, Curie was able to note that uranium electrified the air around it. Further investigation 
                    showed that the activity of uranium compounds depended upon the amount of uranium present and that 
                    radioactivity was not a result of the interactions between molecules, but rather came from the atom 
                    itself. Using Pitchblende and chalcolite Curie found that Thorium was radioactive as well. She later 
                    discovered two new radioactive elements: Radium and Polonium which took her several years since these 
                    elements are difficult to extract and extremely rare. Unfortunately, the Curies died young. Pierre 
                    Curie was killed in a street accident and Marie died of aplastic anemia, almost certainly a result 
                    of radiation exposure.

                    <b>Ernest Rutherford</b> is considered the father of nuclear physics. With his gold foil experiment he was able 
                    to unlock the mysteries of the atomic structure. He received the noble prize in chemistry in 1908. In 1909 at 
                    the University of Manchester, Rutherford was bombarding a piece of gold foil with Alpha particles. Rutherford 
                    noted that although most of the particles went straight through the foil, one in every eight thousand was 
                    deflected back. "It was as if you fired a fifteen inch naval shell at a piece of tissue paper and the shell 
                    came right back and hit you," Rutherford said. He concluded that though an atom consists of mostly empty space, 
                    most of its mass is concentrated in a very small positively charged region known as the nucleus, while electrons 
                    buzz around on the outside.
                    <br><br>
                    Rutherford was also able to observe that radioactive elements underwent a process of decay over time which varied 
                    from element to element. In 1919, Rutherford used alpha particles to transmutate one element (Oxygen) into another 
                    element (Nitrogen). Papers at the timed called it "splitting the atom."

                    <b>Antoine Henri Becquerel</b> received the Nobel Prize in physics for being the first to discover radioactivity as 
                    a phenomenon separate from that of x-rays and document the differences between the two.
                    <br><br>
                    Henri Becquerel learned of Roentgen's discovery of x-rays through the fluorescence that some materials produce. Using 
                    a method similar to that of Roentgen, Becquerel surrounded several photographic plates with black paper and florescent 
                    salts. With the intention of further advancing the study of x-rays, Becquerel intended to place the concealed 
                    photographic paper in the sunlight and observe what transpired. Unfortunately, he had to delay his experiment because 
                    the skies over Paris were overcast. He placed the wrapped plates into a dark desk drawer. After a few days Becquerel 
                    returned to his experiment unwrapping the photographic paper and developing it, expecting only a light imprint from the 
                    salts. Instead, the salts left very distinct outlines in the photographic paper suggesting that the salts, regardless 
                    of lacking an energy source, continually fluoresced. What Becquerel had discovered was radioactivity.

                    <b>Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen</b> received the first Noble Prize in physics for his discovery of x-rays in 1901.
                    On November 8, 1895, at the University of Wurzburg, Roentgen was working in the lab when he noticed a strange 
                    fluorescence coming from a nearby table. Upon further observation he found that it originated from a partially 
                    evacuated Hittof-Crookes tube, covered in opaque black paper which he was using to study cathode rays. He 
                    concluded that the fluorescence, which penetrated the opaque black paper, must have been caused by rays. This 
                    phenomenon was later coined x-rays and though the phenomenon of x-rays is not the same as radioactivity, Roentgen 
                    opened the door for radioactive discovery. <b class="cursorBlink">|</b>
